# Adding the UIS Logo

To display the UIS logo in your portfolio:

## Option 1: Download the Official Logo

1. Visit the UIS website or search for "UIS logo png"
2. Download the logo image (preferably PNG with transparent background)
3. Save it as `uis-logo.png` in the `/public` folder

## Option 2: Use a Placeholder

If you don't have the logo yet, the component will display a graduation cap icon instead.

## File Location

Place your logo here:
```
/home/juanpablo/Portafolio Web/public/uis-logo.png
```

## Recommended Specifications

- **Format**: PNG (with transparent background)
- **Size**: 256x256px or larger
- **File name**: `uis-logo.png`

The component will automatically resize and display it properly.
